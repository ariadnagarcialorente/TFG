Based on the experiment results, I'll analyze the performance of each algorithm and draw key conclusions. The algorithms are evaluated on a 100-point scale across 10 different missingness scenarios (cases). Here's a comprehensive analysis:
Overall Performance Ranking (Average Score)

    v0.4: 77.3

    v0.5: 76.4

    bnb: 69.2

    v0.3: 67.8

    v0.1: 65.1

    v0.2: 64.3

    v0.0: 60.0

Key Conclusions

    v0.4 is the Top Performer:

        Highest average score (77.3) and most consistent

        Excels in data retention (avg 92.3%) and missing value reduction (avg 27.6%)

        Particularly strong in high-missingness scenarios (Case 2, 6, 10) with scores up to 86.3

    Tradeoff Between Missing Value Reduction and Data Retention:

        v0.4/v0.5: Aggressive missing value reduction (avg 27.6/24.0) with moderate column retention (avg 88%/96%)

        bnb/v0.3: Balanced approach (avg 14.5/10.3 reduction with 90%/92% retention)

        v0.0: Preserves 100% data but achieves 0% missing value reduction

    Algorithm Specialization:

        High Missingness (25%+):

            v0.4 dominates (scores 83.6-86.3)

            v0.5 follows closely (79.6-84.9)

        Low Missingness (<15%):

            v0.1 performs best (72.9)

            bnb shows competitive results (69.2)

        Hybrid/MNAR Patterns:

            v0.4 and v0.5 handle complex patterns best

    Critical Constraints Matter:

        All algorithms except v0.0 struggle with the 90% min-percent constraint

        v0.4/v0.5 successfully enforce column thresholds (80-96% retention)

        Important columns bonus (up to 9.6/10) significantly boosts scores

    Efficiency Insights:

        v0.0 is fastest (avg 1.87s) but least effective

        v0.4 achieves best results with moderate runtime (avg 1.81s)

        bnb shows good speed (avg 1.77s) for medium missingness

Case-by-Case Highlights

    Case 7 (Hybrid):

        Only v0.4 succeeded (83.6) - others crashed

        Demonstrated exceptional handling of combined MAR+MNAR patterns

    Case 2 (25% MCAR):

        v0.4 scored 86.3 - best single-case performance

        Reduced missingness by 34.4% while retaining 95% rows

    Case 5 (Strong MNAR):

        v0.5 led with 72.9

        bnb showed worst performance (53.3)


Limitations

    Case 7 implementation needs debugging (file generation failed for most algorithms)

    v0.0 should be deprecated - preserved data but reduced 0% missingness

    v0.2 underperformed consistently due to weak constraint enforcement

The experiments demonstrate that context-aware algorithms (v0.4/v0.5) with parameter tuning outperform simpler approaches, especially when handling complex missingness patterns and enforcing data quality constraints.
